                  <p>
                     Liberty Technology Services was founded with a simple but often overlooked belief:
                     <strong>technology should work for you — without compromising security, privacy, or control.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     I’m <strong>Jared Waite</strong>, a U.S. military veteran and software manager at a large technology company, with over five years of professional experience working in modern, large-scale technology
                     environments. Throughout my career, I’ve seen firsthand how powerful technology can be when it’s designed intentionally — and how harmful it can be when convenience comes at the cost of security and
                     personal data.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     My background spans enterprise software management, security-conscious system design, and real-world implementation of reliable, scalable technology. That experience shapes every solution Liberty
                     Technology Services delivers. We focus on practical, professional-grade systems that prioritize stability, privacy, and long-term usability — not gimmicks or subscription-driven ecosystems.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     I’ve always had a passion for helping individuals and businesses leverage technology to improve daily life, streamline operations, and reduce friction, while maintaining ownership of their data and
                     infrastructure. Whether it’s networking, security, or automation, my goal is to demystify technology and show clients how to use it confidently and responsibly.
                  </p>

                  <p>At Liberty Technology Services, we believe the best solutions are the ones you can trust — systems that are secure by design, resilient by nature, and built to serve you long after installation day.</p>
